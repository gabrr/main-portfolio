# main-portfolio
This is my portfolio which will contain my favorite projects, tips and also it will be used as a customer service platform

## New Ideas

1. The projects pics will be moving randomly. few pixels to left and top and then a few pixels down right. 
If the user clicks and hold it, he will be able to move the picture. Or maybe passing the mouse will change the cards position.


2. My hero could be a video. Vignette around the video. it'd start with a movement of my head from looking down to looking straight ahead,
my eyes from closed to opened. Finally there must have a light above, and it moves to face, so the borders keep dark but the center bright.
